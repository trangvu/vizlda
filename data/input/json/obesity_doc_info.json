Norman-Swan : have there be intervention study suggest lose-weight brain regenerate . Paul-Thompson : well be interesting study have mainly be exercise rather change diet be very very difficult disentangle be diet be affect brain bebe study folate vitamin-B sort supplement take affect brain . be very very difficult study do so normally intervention have be something tackle blood-flow directly take-up fitness program not be extremely strenuous maybe walk few extra block have generally be very positive people have do study extra exercise more activity general generally find stave-off brain loss age . Norman-Swan : have study brain imaging . Paul-Thompson : have so look brain scan super exerciser be people be old-age very active walk mile day brain be just much more intact counterpart ask question : bebe do matter . mean do have do something strenuous ... . Norman-Swan : have have intact brain allow exercise rather exercise give stronger brain tissue . Paul-Thompson : oh control be very-good point not not just look whole lot people say well people unhealthy brain -- roll-out people be not physically able walk be active look people basically getup off foot know wander sort thing type amount exercise matter seem first level anyone be just walk-around keep active know 60-70 tend look much better term brain integrity blood-flow be kind common-sense mean make sense see . then look strenuous do exercise have be anyone get heart-rate sweat little-bit keep blood-flow little-bit better seem have extra benefit brain sheer effect know basically bump calorie kind thing . Norman-Swan : do go next kind research be very-well look scan have get look whole persona well . Paul-Thompson : do lot intervention bebe pair up standard clinical-trial so lot drug company be curious -- be medication beneficial brain age . have lot new lead none be panacea be moderately helpful be lot question : people say do supplement help ; do help lot ; be money . be only help do other sensible thing think be see bit seachange healthy-diet exercise maybe medication be test together .

Karen-Carey : society believe equal access best health-care treatment everyone cost be become unsustainable . so change way health-care be provide deny people access treatment . well new research be show target health-care individual instead treat everyone same way not only save health-care dollar health outcome improve aswell . david huntsman : way bebe consider be say instead treat health-care problem generically start better understand specific health-care need individual term risk develop disease then be diagnose disease be manage -- be able do better job .

Karen-Carey : risk be very real particularly condition involve mental-health long-term chronic illness significantly level bias still exist other thing experience tell be once create information be almost impossible keep totally secure . country have specific legislation protect people discrimination base genetic information u-s have gina genetic information non-discrimination a-c-t australia many other country have protection . david huntsman : be go take large-amount engagement broad range different type researcher general-public be go have be partner research determine use genomic not just talk testing specific gene cancer individual family-history disease full genomic safely effectively be very exciting endeavour be go bring lot people together . Karen-Carey : challenge be person have genome test be willing accept risk disclosure family member share same genetic material not want take risk . david huntsman : have family have very different sort view privacy family have part family be very private keep thing risk cancer very personal secret share close family member only just deal medical basis have relative be also work want post genetic-testing result facebook cause lot issue . be many thing cause issue family . Karen-Carey : map genome individual have promise deliver better health outcome huge savings be complex issue have not have sufficient public attention debate . government be move much slower advance technology be leave most vulnerable people unprotected .
